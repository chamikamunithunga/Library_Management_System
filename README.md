Features of this Frontend :
--------------------------

Book class: Contains attributes for a book and a method to display its details.

Library class: Manages a collection of books, allowing users to add, view, and search books.

Main program loop: Provides an interactive console menu where users can perform actions like adding books, viewing the collection, or searching by title.

Display List: The list of books is dynamically updated and displayed on the page.

How it Works:
--------------
HTML & CSS handle the structure and basic styling of the page.

JavaScript:
-----------
Stores the books in a books[] array.

Handles adding a new book to the list with the addBook() function.

Dynamically updates the displayed book list on the page by calling displayBooks() after each book is added.

You can extend the functionality by adding more features like:

Search functionality.

Edit and remove options for each book.

Persistent storage using localStorage to save books between sessions.
